Since I was a kid I have always been interested in computers and technology. When I began my matriculation I found it very difficult to settle on a major. I started out as a pre-med student and eventually settled with a chemistry major. I liked chemistry and it came easy to me. I did a few internships working with solar energy and ultimatey fell in love with that, but not so much the chemitry part of it. I enjoyed the challenges and creativity that chemial solar energy research offered me, but the day to day life of actually performing the experiments was something I knew that i did not want to do for very long. Searchng for something that was equaly as challeneging and also allowed me to be creative and imaginative., I started to take up software development. 

In the beginning, I was only teaching my self the basics and building small, simple functioning applications. I ejoyed the thrill of debugging my code and fitting together many small pieces to finally have something functional that I created. I loved the fact that I could create anything I want using only my brain, my computer, and the internet. I then took a leap of faith and changed my major to computer science to learn more advanced concepts and give more structure to my learning journey. Unfortunately, financial mishaps found me and left me with no other choice but to put a pause on school and get a full-time job. I tried again with my self-taught path and agin found myself lost in the endless world of resources with no idea of how to direct my learnings. 

I had herad of people participating in online coding bootcamps while they work full-time jobs and I was intrigued. I reserched many differnet bootcamps, and finally decding to enroll with Flatiron School. Although, I know this course will be difficut, I am excited about this journey and I cannot wait to finish and graduate. The moment I land my first software developer job will be worth it all.
