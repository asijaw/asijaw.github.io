React is a simple, yet powerful open source front-end library that allows developers to create large scale applications on the internet. Created by Facebook, it is loved by many people in the developer community. Things like components, simplified lifecycles, and its coupling with other technologies such as Redux make it crowd favorite. React components provided separation of concerns in a way that allows the developer to isolate different tasks of the program and create or insert reusable code. This functionality is good for decreasing the time it takes to get a working application up and running and decreasing repetitive code. 

These components render their output based on state or props. Props are pieces of data that are passed to a component when it is called. This data can not be changed. State is bound to an instance of a component. This data can be passed down as props to children components. The value of local state changes over the lifetime of that instance of the component. Store state, provided by redux, allows access across many components of the application. These components are able to update or setState in the store allowing for ease of access to data. 

React is a great library for front-end development. With the help of other technologies, like Redux, it can be a dynamic tool for building large scale applications.
