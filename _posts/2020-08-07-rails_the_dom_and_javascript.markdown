Integrating Rails backend with frontend Javascript was a nice way to create web pages. Using these two languages together provided me with the tools I needed to create a structured backend and a interactive frontend. Instead of redirecting the user with each click, the user remained on one static webpage. This is a better user experience an more in sync with the way that webpages are displayed today. This is made possible through DOM manipulation, recognizing events, and server communication.

The DOM or Document Object Model allows a developer to use HTML in order to display information to a user on a webpage. What used to be the views in Rails is now DOM manipulation with the help of Javascript and HTML. Using Javascript to manipulate the DOM allows for more dynamic and interactive webpages. This interaction is possible with the DOMs ability to recognize events. These events such as clicks and submissions are registered and trigger a function that can change the appearance on the webpage. These changes are then communicated with the server which allow the changes to be saved in the database. Now when the page is refreshed, all the changed that have been made can still exist.

Using Rails, the DOM, and Javascript together allows for an endless possibility of what you can make happen on a single webpage.
